# Round-Robin-Preemptive-Scheduling-Simulation
Given program as stated depicts the simulation of round robin CPU scheduling with the option of pre-emption as well. <br><br>The objective of the code was to design a scheduling algorithm that would support pre-emption, ensure no deadlocks would occur, tackle starvation by preventing it and simulate its results. <br><br>In this code you will find that pre-emption is supported, round robin algorithm is implemented for preventing starvation by giving each program a fixed time slice which if overshot is sent back to ready queue(which also helps in managing deadlocks by preventing it) and memory size has been set to 1000(MB) for the simulation. Queues have been used for maintaining the sequence of programs and the ready queue and also to store the executing programs(for simplicity of operating). <br><br>The code basically produces the sequence of operations taking place in the scheduling algorithm(traversal between the queues and execution) as output.
